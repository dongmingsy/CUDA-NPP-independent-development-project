#EDGE DETECTION based on CUDA NPP sample 
CUDA-NPP-independent-development-project
peer review project for "CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise"
This is based on NPP CUDA sample that proceeding edge detection of a image.
The original sample only support pgm format image's edge detection.
In this project, I support png format image detection. Both pgm and png can be passed to the executable. 
I tried various images from Internet, the results are under ./data directory. The *_cannyEdgeDector_*.png/pgm are the output generated by the executable. To demostrate more clearly, I convert the pgm to png to be more visible.
