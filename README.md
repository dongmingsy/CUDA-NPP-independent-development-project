#EDGE DETECTION based on CUDA NPP sample 
CUDA-NPP-independent-development-project
peer review project for "CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise"
This is based on NPP CUDA sample that proceeding edge detection of a image.
The original sample only support pgm format image's edge detection.
Png format image detection is supported by this project. Both pgm and png can be passed to the executable. 
Tested various images from Internet, the results are under ./data directory. The *_cannyEdgeDector_*.png/pgm are the output generated by the executable. To demostrate more clearly, I convert the pgm to png to be more visible.
