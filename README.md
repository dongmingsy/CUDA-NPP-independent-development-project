# cannyEdgeDetectorNPP - Canny Edge Detector NPP

## Description
This is based on NPP CUDA sample that proceeding edge detection of a image.
The original sample only support pgm format image's edge detection.
In this project, I support png format image detection. Both pgm and png can be passed to the executable. 
I tried various images from Internet, the results are under ./data directory. The *_cannyEdgeDector_*.png/pgm are the output generated by the executable. To demostrate more clearly, I convert the pgm to png to be more visible.

An NPP CUDA Sample that demonstrates the recommended parameters to use with the nppiFilterCannyBorder_8u_C1R Canny Edge Detection image filter function. This function expects a single channel 8-bit grayscale input image. You can generate a grayscale image from a color image by first calling nppiColorToGray() or nppiRGBToGray(). The Canny Edge Detection function combines and improves on the techniques required to produce an edge detection image using multiple steps.

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[FreeImage](../../../README.md#freeimage), [NPP](../../../README.md#npp)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."

### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options:
*  **TARGET_ARCH=<arch>** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l.
    By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64.<br/>
`$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` <br/>
    See [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cross-samples) for more details.
*   **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols
    ```
    $ make dbg=1
    ```
*   **SMS="A B ..."** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `"A B ..."` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS="50 60"`.
    ```
    $ make SMS="50 60"
    ```

*  **HOST_COMPILER=<host_compiler>** - override the default g++ host compiler. See the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements) for a list of supported host compilers.
```
    $ make HOST_COMPILER=g++
```
